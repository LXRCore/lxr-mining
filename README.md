## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

**LXR-Mining** is highly customizable. You can easily add or modify mining locations, resources, and selling prices by editing the `config.lua` file.

### Example Configuration:
```lua
Config = {}

-- Mining Locations
Config.MiningSpots = {
    { coords = vector3(-594.29, 2091.82, 131.57), radius = 5.0, resource = 'stone' },
    { coords = vector3(-602.45, 2096.58, 131.57), radius = 5.0, resource = 'iron' },
}

-- Refinery Locations
Config.RefinerySpots = {
    { coords = vector3(2945.58, 2783.95, 40.94), radius = 3.0 }
}

-- Selling Locations
Config.SellSpots = {
    { coords = vector3(-341.13, 767.98, 115.66), radius = 3.0 }
}

-- Resource Processing
Config.Resources = {
    ['stone'] = { refined = 'stone_refined', amount = 2 },
    ['iron'] = { refined = 'iron_refined', amount = 2 },
}

-- Sell Prices
Config.SellPrices = {
    ['stone_refined'] = 10,
    ['iron_refined'] = 25,
}
```

### How it works:
- **Mining**: Players can mine at specific locations and gather raw materials like stone or iron.
- **Refining**: Players must take their raw materials to a refinery location to process them into usable goods.
- **Selling**: Refined materials can then be sold at designated selling points for currency.
